            <h2  id="aboutme">About Me</h2>
                <p>I was born in Garden City, Kansas on October 26, 1999 when I had both parents in my life. I have two older sisters, one little brother & one little half-sister. My hobbies are to play bask. I plan on creating a factory to help the world.</p>
                <p>I want to travel the world by myself to discover things that I've never seen before. Also to try new foods that I never tried before. One thing I really want to do is adopt a child from somewhere out of the country.</p>
